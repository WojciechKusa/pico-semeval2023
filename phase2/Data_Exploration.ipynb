      "I just had my 3rd tysabri infusion today. I was wondering if any other people on tysabri notice they get a slight worsening of old symptoms hours after infusion? For example, normally my hug only is around the front of my chest, but its wrapped around my back now like it had in the past. Or maybe thats just what back pain feels like  So perhaps Im just getting typical side effects. I never have any side effects when Im monitored in the hour after my actual IV drip, though. \n",
      "\n",
      "I read an old thread on here that someone said she thinks that her immune system is retaliating because it can no longer cross the blood brain barrier. That doesnt sound scientific lol but it makes sense to me kinda. Did anyone else have trouble with their first several tysabri infusions? And how long did it take you to adjust and/or see improvement? This is my very first DMT so I have no experience with anything else. Im hoping I can see some symptom improvement in the future.\n",

      "Crazy amount of sardines caused gout (possibly cured?)\n",
      "Hello! Throughout the last 1.5 years I've been eating maybe 2 cans of sardines a day on average. I realize this sounds crazy but almost everything I read showed that sardines are like salmon but without the mercury and there were even articles saying daily consumption of sardines is safe. A few months ago I had a minor gout attack (very small amount of pain) and didn't realize what it was. Then I had a much worse one 2 months later, realized what it was, went on NSAIDS etc. The pain went away almost immediately from NSAIDs, literally in 10h maybe (at least it went to 1% of what it was) the swelling went down but stayed a bit and never really went away. A few weeks later I went to the beach, had some champagne and lobster (I had read lobster wasn't so high in purines, less than chicken) [https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf](https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf) and hoped that this wouldn't do anything. I also went on a hike the next day. The day after that I got another gout attack (worse than first, not as bad as second). \n",
      "\n",
      "I have totally cut out sardines and pretty much all meat from my diet, I've never really had any sugar in my diet except through fruit, I follow a very strict diet 99% of the time (except when celebrating). Pretty much just oatmeal, eggs, kale, avocados, etc). \n",
      "\n",
      "I have read that gout can't be cured, that it's caused by a number of factors outside of diet including kidneys unable to flush uric acid quickly enough, enzymes in body from genetics producing too much uric acid, autoimmune and inflammation issues etc. I have had my kidneys tested and they flush uric acid at a normal rate, I have had my chronic inflammation levels tested (through c reactive protein liver tests) and it is normal as well. I also have had my uric acid tested at 7.9 (months after cutting out sardines). \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems completely reasonable that gout could be caused temporarily by a huge amount of purines and uric acid (like if you injected yourself with uric acid and got your rate to 20 or 30 for example, physically it seems like it would ALWAYS crystalize at high enough levels. For this reason (not necessarily arguing that it's true in my case) it seems like gout could be cured in some cases by lowering uric acid levels (only in people who would never get it normally and had some action that caused a huge amount of abnormal build up like eating 2-3 cans of sardines a day). \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I have not read anything about gout being \"cured\" and this sub seems to mainly say that diet actually has a limited impact and rarely helps (most people seem to recommend allopurinol). I totally understand this, for many people gout is caused by the factors I mentioned above, not changed by diet, but it seems reasonable that crazy diets could cause temporary gout, cured through the normalization of that diet. Is there some flaw in my reasoning here?\n",

      "\n",
      "**Purpose:** The aim of this study was to assess the superiority of low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAPs) diet plus Bacillus coagulans supplementation to low FODMAP diet alone in the reduction of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Methods:** In this randomized clinical trial, fifty IBS patients who met Rome IV criteria for IBS were randomly assigned to receive a low FODMAP diet plus either a probiotic or a placebo capsule for 8 weeks. Probiotic capsules contained 109B. coagulans spores and 400 mg inulin, while placebo capsules consisted of 500 mg rice starch.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Results:** Significant improvements were observed in abdominal pain intensity and frequency, abdominal distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, quality of life, defecation consistency, and patient-reported severity score in both groups; however, only improvement in severity score was significantly higher in probiotic group compared with placebo group (P = 0.001). Moreover, the frequency of patients with clinical improvement in IBS-symptom severity scale (IBS-SSS) was significantly more in probiotic group compared to placebo group (P = 0.038).\n",

      "No Dx Yet but symptoms point to MS\n",
      "Hi, Im new to Reddit and to this community. I honestly need some opinions and/or advice on what to do because I cant figure out what Im experiencing. I am a 32yo Female and have been suffering from migraines since my teenage years so those are nothing new for me but maybe for the past 2+ years Ive been experiencing different kinds of migraines that now accompany severe vertigo/dizziness, constantly. I have seen an ENT and a neuro who only said my migraines are bad and nothing they be concerned about. However, 2 weeks ago I was freaked out and decided I definitely needed to do something about this when I had to pull over on my way to work. I had a vertigo episode that blurred and doubled my vision at the same time and I honestly thought I was going to get into a car accident. I pulled over and let it pass and went to work but I felt like complete crap. I had my co worker drive me to the nearest ER and after a 5 hour wait in the lobby (due to COVID surge) I was finally evaluated by a neuro team and they did say my symptoms point to possible MS. They immediately took me in for a CT and MRI scans but those scans came back normal. Blood work also normal. I was still admitted and they gave me a cocktail of meds. The last cocktail they gave me contained boric acid and prochlorpezaine which broke my headache cycle but not my dizziness. I eventually got discharged upon my request a day early because I was extremely anxious and was in a room with 6 other patients with different conditions and I couldnt do it anymore. They told me to follow up with a neuro but that neuro cant see me for another 2 months in March. Luckily, I had already made a neuro appt 3 months ago before this last episode and my appt is finally tomorrow through FaceTime. I dont want me symptoms to be dismissed. Its been 2 years and Im getting worse. Now I have this burning sensation on my left knee that I wasnt experiencing before as well as swelling of my feet and a tightness feeling. I hate googling things but I dont know much about MS and I want to become more educated. Im scared and I already have autoimmune disease (Hashimotos) which I know has a lot of its own symptoms but if I do have MS how long before I get diagnosed? I really dont want to wait another year \n",

I also take corlanor for my POTS which I was hoping to feel so much better with taking it, but honestly no change in the way I feel. So I guess my question is has anyone else had the same issue and if so what do I even do to see if I have it? Is this something I can just bring up to my primary doctor about? And if this is common, how common is it and why arent we all tested for it.

Saw the Dr again and my urate levels were 10.7 mg/dL. My doctor wants me to take colchesine twice a day for two months, THEN he'll prescribe allopurinol at 300mg, and I'm to take both meds for a month before stopping the colchesine.

      "\n",
      "Citing the article:\n",
      "\n",
      "**NEDA-3 has recently been launched as an ambitious treatment goal in the clinical management of MS, striving for complete suppression of inflammatory disease activity. In patients who have obtained such a label, a significantly lower rate of BVL was demonstrated across the evaluation period, compared with their counterparts who did not [17,18], although the difference with normal aging has not been extensively investigated yet. Our study now shows a similar degree of whole brain and total gray matter volume decline in patients with MS, as measured between two MRI time points demarcating a period of NEDA-3, and a group of healthy volunteers who were matched for age and sex, suggesting that neurodegeneration can slow down to physiological levels once inflammatory disease activity has been silenced.**\n",
      "\n",
      "What is NEDA-3?\n",
      "\n",
      "The term no evidence of disease activity-3 (NEDA-3) has been introduced to identify patients receiving such DMT who are completely free from new relapses, MRI lesion accrual and clinical disability worsening. NEDA-3 is a composite measure with a possible twin significance: i.e., no detectable evidence of inflammation (as manifested by the absence of new relapses and MRI lesions) nor neurodegeneration (as deduced from the clinical stability).\n",
      "\n",
      "These findings are in line with those from a prospective Norwegian cohort studyto our knowledge, the only other direct comparative trial in this fieldin which 57 patients with early relapsing-remitting MS were stratified into a NEDA-3 (49%) versus EDA (51%) category based on 1 year of follow-up. The authors did not find a statistically significant increase in annualized subcortical gray matter volume loss, using the freely available FreeSurfer (Charleston, MA, USA) analytical software, in the MS patients with NEDA-3, as compared with an age- and gender-matched control group.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Our conclusions are seemingly contradicted by reports revealing considerable rates of MS patients achieving NEDA-3 to have a whole BVL above the anticipated pathological threshold of 0.4% per year [22,23,24]. However, such general cut-offs are unlikely to be applicable to all participants and a substantial portion was under a lower-efficacy platform DMT regimen (i.e., interferon  or glatiramere acetate), also illustrating the heterogeneity of studies addressing this issue.*\n",

      "Hello! Throughout the last 1.5 years I've been eating maybe 2 cans of sardines a day on average. I realize this sounds crazy but almost everything I read showed that sardines are like salmon but without the mercury and there were even articles saying daily consumption of sardines is safe. A few months ago I had a minor gout attack (very small amount of pain) and didn't realize what it was. Then I had a much worse one 2 months later, realized what it was, went on NSAIDS etc. The pain went away almost immediately from NSAIDs, literally in 10h maybe (at least it went to 1% of what it was) the swelling went down but stayed a bit and never really went away. A few weeks later I went to the beach, had some champagne and lobster (I had read lobster wasn't so high in purines, less than chicken) [https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf](https://elevatehealthaz.com/wp-content/Purine%20Table.pdf) and hoped that this wouldn't do anything. I also went on a hike the next day. The day after that I got another gout attack (worse than first, not as bad as second). \n",

      "I have totally cut out sardines and pretty much all meat from my diet, I've never really had any sugar in my diet except through fruit, I follow a very strict diet 99% of the time (except when celebrating). Pretty much just oatmeal, eggs, kale, avocados, etc). \n",
      "\n",
      "I have read that gout can't be cured, that it's caused by a number of factors outside of diet including kidneys unable to flush uric acid quickly enough, enzymes in body from genetics producing too much uric acid, autoimmune and inflammation issues etc. I have had my kidneys tested and they flush uric acid at a normal rate, I have had my chronic inflammation levels tested (through c reactive protein liver tests) and it is normal as well. I also have had my uric acid tested at 7.9 (months after cutting out sardines). \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems completely reasonable that gout could be caused temporarily by a huge amount of purines and uric acid (like if you injected yourself with uric acid and got your rate to 20 or 30 for example, physically it seems like it would ALWAYS crystalize at high enough levels. For this reason (not necessarily arguing that it's true in my case) it seems like gout could be cured in some cases by lowering uric acid levels (only in people who would never get it normally and had some action that caused a huge amount of abnormal build up like eating 2-3 cans of sardines a day). \n",
      "\n",
      "However, I have not read anything about gout being \"cured\" and this sub seems to mainly say that diet actually has a limited impact and rarely helps (most people seem to recommend allopurinol). I totally understand this, for many people gout is caused by the factors I mentioned above, not changed by diet, but it seems reasonable that crazy diets could cause temporary gout, cured through the normalization of that diet.

As I think people know here in this subreddit, the anti-seizure medication has lots of side effects that affect daily life. My boyfriend's brother is also trying professionally prescribed CBD treatments, but he finds this frustrating because the cbd is not covered by our government Healthcare plans and he pays a high amount for CBD oil and doesn't feel like it's making much of a difference. \n",

Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have.

      "The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.\n",

So to follow up, Ive been on Prednisone now since Friday and its helped a ton with the pain and my ankle has nearly returned completely to normal, however I am now getting a bit of a flare up in my left toe (the other foot).

I asked about a rheumatologist (everyones said I should talk to one) but she said theres nothing more they could tell me that I havent heard already. Another questionable thing she told me was that if the medication Im on for blood pressure, between the diuretic and diltiazem, she thinks the latter is more likely to have caused the gout. But diltiazem only has like a 1-2% chance of causing gout whereas a diuretic is a leading cause in a lot of cases Ive read. So Im also seeking advice on whether or not I should just call her back and get her to send me to a specialist or wait and see how this toe flare up goes.\n",

      " A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.  \n",

If I feel extra fatigued after a long day, I start rifling through my activities, wondering what could have possibly made my legs so sore, and then I remember that sometimes just going through a day makes me stiff and sore like Id done a rigorous exercise. That swallowing thing is a real bitch, too. People dont realize how alarming it is to expect your throat to just do what it always does and send the food back and down your gullet only for there to be no motion, and for the act of swallowing to become mechanical, like writing out specific instructions to your throat on how to do its job. But really, its not about the swallowing, or the night sweats, or being constantly sick, or the tingling and the numbness, or the fatigue. Its about the degeneration. Its about the fact that every time I show a symptom, Im reminded that my body has attacked that delicate myelin sheath around my nerves and that that process will continue, even if its slowed down by Ocrevus.

      "There seem to be several replies of late that tend to imply that some of us on this forum think UA lowering medication is the only answer.  Although it may not be the only answer - it is one that is medically proven to actually affect the real trigger of gout - monosodium urate crystals.  If you are on here often you will see me post a link to this article - \"Why does a gout attack stop\"\n",

      "And I post this often because I was under the illusion that somehow MSU crystals came and went with an attack.  IE I get an attack because I formed crystals.  Then the attack went away so the crystals went away.  Understanding that stopping the flare does not mean the crystals went away is the key point I try to make to everyone.  Anecdotally - if you look at my story - really what was happening to me is my UA levels kept going up and crystals started forming all over my joints. (Hence the attacks at various parts of my body). The crystals were still there - even with my serum UA levels below 6mg/dL for 6 months.  That is why I flared when I ate my trigger food.  Crystals still didn't finish dissolving even after 6 months of \"normal UA levels\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "What does that mean for diet?  I would change the word to lifestyle change.  You basically have to keep eating for the rest of your life - food that would keep your UA levels below 6 mg/dL so that crystals can dissolve and so that you won't form new crystals.  Also you might still flare while those crystals dissolve.  Any other diet is just dealing with the inflammation not with the MSU crystals.  You'd need to monitor your UA levels so that you know you are keeping it low.  And obviously it isn't super easy to dissolve crystals - 6 months for me - and I've read about some people in the year(s) range and still having flares.  \n",

      "Hi guys!!! So I just wanted to post something thats been going on with my POTS lately, but I know everyone is different. My symptoms started January of 2021 for reference. Ive had the hardest time with it and have had most days where Im down including just last week (I did have omicron though so maybe thats why). So bc of omicron I started to take vitamins I knew I was deficient of bc I heart it helps fight the virus. Yes I could have been doing this all along but I was more focused on the savior pills like beta blockers and Clonazepam. PLEASE GET A BLOOD TEST FOR VITAMIN LEVELS!!! I started to take two D vitamins and my prescribed B vitamin (Im superrrrrr deficient in B) consistently along with a couple others and all of a sudden after a couple weeks of consistency my heart rate is NORMAL without beta blockers or Clonazepam even if I stand. My adrenaline feelings have gone away. I looked up what vitamin deficiency symptoms are particularly B and D and its most of what I was feeling everyday!! Heart palpitations, breathlessness, fatigue, etc. this is the only thing I have changed and I have tried so much. My palpitations have gone down too!!! Please please please try this. I literally cried yesterday because this is the most normal I have felt in so long!!!\n",

      "Hi all, I am 31 years old male and recently did a general series of blood tests since I was about to leave to a remote place with poor access to medical facilities. My serum uric acid level in the test is 6.9 mg/dl. I don't have any pain like gout and I deduce this from reading posts in this community. However, I have had a slight bunion in my left foot since a couple of years. However, the pain from bunion went away once I started wearing a toe separator prescribed by an Orthopedic Physician. No pain since then. The pain comes if I don't wear the toe separator for at least a couple of days and walk around for quite some time. However, the pain only comes while walking and there is no swelling as such. I am able to bend my toe backwards. The bunion occured at a time when I was taking calcium supplements for another issue.\n",

However, since the bloodwork says that the maximum value of serum uric acid is 7.0, I am confused if I should start the medication or take a second opinion. With your experience, what do you people suggest? I know that most of you might not be doctors, but I am sure that dealing with gout for long, you might have something to say.\n",

      "Has anyone gotten diagnosed with POTS and also been diagnosed with coronary disease? I had an EKG along with other tests to get diagnosed with POTS recently, and my cardiologist said he saw some arterial plaque on the scan. I got a coronary calcium CT scan, and I have a score of 74 -- it indicates some small spots of arterial plaque. I'm 46, and my cardiologist said I am young to be having coronary artery disease. It will be a while before I get in to see the cardiologist again, and I'm just wondering if anyone else has experienced this? The recommendations for arterial plaque all assume high blood pressure and recommend things I can't do, like decrease salt intake, increase exercise, take statins, etc. My POTS symptoms started since I had Covid 5 months ago, and I guess maybe Covid could have increased heart inflammation and be helping cause the arterial plaque.

I was finally diagnosed with Sibo 4 months ago. If you suspect there may be something else wrong with you please look into this!! Most doctors dont know a ton on this topic(including GI DRs) and its a strange breath test to detect. For anyone who believes they just have IBS, please disregard this message.

      "\n",
      "Edit: If you test for Sibo you have to test for all 3 types - Methane Sibo, Hydrogen Sibo, and Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo. The doctors normally only tests for Methane Sibo and Hydrogen Sibo and there is a chance your results will come up negative although you have it. This could be an inconclusive test. The reason for this is that Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo is more dominant and it competes with Methane Sibo to eat Hydrogen Sibo. When the Hydrogen Sibo is gone(all eaten) the Methane Sibo dies off leaving your results for both at 0, but you could still very well have Hydrogen Sulfide Sibo and you wouldnt know it and your DR wouldnt know it. There is a test called Trio smart breath at home test kit that tests for all 3. Order it online and get your doctor to sign off on it if you can. This is really only a concern for anyone who tests at a 0 for Methane and Hydrogen. I tested positive for both but I still need to test for Sulfide Sibo as the protocol for treating this kind is totally different than treating Methane and Hydrogen and is its own kind of beast. If you find you have Sibo get yourself a good intestinal Naturopathic Dr. to help guide you through.\n",

Fungus and bacteria compete for a hospitable living environment in your intestinal tract and this causes the bacteria to grow stronger and multiply.\n",

My seizures are also more intense now on those specific days. Before the change, they were shorter and didn't really exhaust me as much as they do now. The side effects are much better now but on days without proper sleep they are guaranteed bad ones. I don't lose concience during any of my seizures but it's still annoying not to be able to finish my workouts because my brain goes bonkers. The new meds made my overall situation better but I feel like all the bs just shifts and doesn't want to go away no matter what you do. I know that I am lucky to have a mild form of epilepsy but the constant remider that you cannot do the things you want to do like working out or late night gaming with friends once in a while. Not without getting f'd over the next day. A proper sleep schedule would probably help me avoid some of those problems but working irregular shifts makes that quite impossible. Can't wait for better cannabis legalization in Germany to try and reduce my dosage. I know you all probably feel that frustration too.

      "\n",
      ">THE RELATION BETWEEN CREATINE AND GOUT\n",
      ">Based on scientific research, the relation between creatine and gout is fairly simple to explain. Creatine  as well as foods high in creatine  will overwhelm the body with purines  the primary cause of gout. As a result, the creatine supplementation will inevitably increase the levels of uric acid and the probability to develop gout. The same effects will target men with or without gout. Creatine can cause flareups in those with gout, but it can also cause gout in those without it.\n",
      "\n",
      ">On the same note, if you take a creatine supplement and you experience gout, you need to cease the supplementation and discuss it with your doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Bottom line, there is a very solid relation between creatine and gout. Just like you research labels to find foods with no purines whatsoever, you should do the same for supplements  and creatine is highly contraindicated. Even if you do not experience flareups while taking creatine or you do not have gout, chances are the high levels of uric acid will take you there at some point or another.\n",

Thankfully thats not the case. Ive had my heart checked (holter monitor, EKGs and most recently an echocardiogram). My primary doctor said that if the echocardiogram results came back normal, which they did, then she is pretty confident that I may have POTs. However, my cardiologist never mentioned POTs and didnt sound too worried about my symptoms, and my primary doctor doesnt think I need to be tested any further.\n",

Around this time I also started having dull chest pains and shortness of breath accompanied by a high heart rate anytime Id stand and walk. Part of this I thought was due to some anxiety, because I began worrying something was wrong with my heart. It still gets very high. At rest, lying horizontally, my resting heart rate will be in the 80s on a good day, but rise to 120-130 easily upon standing and walking. Im afraid to start working out again even though my doctor has said its okay to because I feel like it could easily get to 200 or more.\n",

I have seen my family doctor and they referred me to a specialist. The specialist said the most common heart condition is SVT (supraventricular tachycardia) and slapped that diagnosis on me. He didnt really do any tests or ask about my symptoms. I went back again and said I dont think its SVT as it isnt acute 5 minute episodes, its chronic fatigue and weakness as well as high HR and intolerance to being in an upright position. He dismissed it and said you know what we never really figure out why people have these issues, they just have them and thats that. He said the fatigue is probably from the beta blockers he has me on for SVT, however its such a low dose I didnt experience any fatigue when I started them.\n",

Im fairly certain that isnt an accurate test for POTS but I didnt argue with them. I also have days where I feel fine and days where just standing to cook some food feels like running a marathon. Of course the day they did the test I felt fine.\n",

      "\n",
      ">THE RELATION BETWEEN CREATINE AND GOUT\n",
      ">Based on scientific research, the relation between creatine and gout is fairly simple to explain. Creatine  as well as foods high in creatine  will overwhelm the body with purines  the primary cause of gout. As a result, the creatine supplementation will inevitably increase the levels of uric acid and the probability to develop gout. The same effects will target men with or without gout. Creatine can cause flareups in those with gout, but it can also cause gout in those without it.\n",
      "\n",
      ">On the same note, if you take a creatine supplement and you experience gout, you need to cease the supplementation and discuss it with your doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Bottom line, there is a very solid relation between creatine and gout. Just like you research labels to find foods with no purines whatsoever, you should do the same for supplements  and creatine is highly contraindicated. Even if you do not experience flareups while taking creatine or you do not have gout, chances are the high levels of uric acid will take you there at some point or another.\n",

      "Hey yall I used to be in the same boat. Every puff of thc would get me into a full blown psychosis that lasts roughly about 48-72 hrs. I suffer with bipolar 2 and these weed psychosis didnt always start off like that. It started off as predrome psychosis exclusively from THC withdrawl. Because of the sudden absence of THC affecting dopamine levels. This started happening at the age of 16. I could smoke weed but for some reason couldnt quit . Then at age 20 full blown psychosis starts occurring during and after weed consumption. Psychosis lasted about 48-72hrs. The only cure for this issue is literally taking your Anti psychotics and wait them to take FULL effect up to 6 weeks to see results. Now I literally smoke like a champ. 95% thc distillate to the face every 3 hours and have not suffer psychosis in the last 8 months even if I withdrawal from weed. The medication that absolutely removed all this nonsense was called seroquel 300 XR. The power of anti psychotics is amazing that it even creates a barrier between THC. So remember take your meds! And stay away from ADHD meds , that can also fuck you up so if your adhd like me fuck it u better off taking Zoloft and APs\n",

      "Hi All,\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm still relatively new here and looking to get some input on my specific situation. 27M. Last year I had an episode of numbness and tingling on my left side (arm and leg). It went away after about 4 days, but the incident kick-started a long line of tests which ended up in my MS diagnosis. I have 6-8 demyelinating brain lesions visible on MRI. All spinal MRIs were clear. I saw an MS specialist who said that only spinal lesions would cause symptoms in the extremities. This means that my MS lesions in my brain did not cause my numbness/tingling and have not caused any symptoms yet. The doctor said that because of this, treatment can be delayed, and I would be monitored every six months or so with an MRI. This is an MS specialist doctor with a reputable clinic.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any merit to this approach in your view? Obviously the idea of delaying these medications is appealing, but I also know it's playing with fire. It's frustrating because in general I have always been averse to taking medication, so what this doctor said what pretty much what I wanted to hear. I don't want to be unwise and risk unneeded damage, but I also wonder if this is in fact radiologically isolated syndrome, which to my understanding *is* supposed to be monitored before treatment starts.

      "Hi gang. Im wondering if anyone has experienced a relapse that does not show new lesion activity on MRI? I had my scans at the beginning of Feb and all is stable (yay!). But I started having some weakness in my arm around the same time and it was a bit insidious in that it was kind of slow to come on and then got worse quite quickly. I had been having sensory issues in that arm for so long (neuro aware) but I had a disc issue in my c spine last year so I chalked it up to that. My MRI shows that disc issue is fully resolved and back its vertebrae house (also yay!). But my left arm and hand are very weak and it has spread across my shoulders. I also have spasticity in my left armpit, my ribcage is in pain and feels tight. My specialist is not convinced that what is happening right now is mechanical, which was my assumption and why I waited to report the symptoms until my arm was so weak that I couldnt really function very well. Which in hindsight, I should have called earlier. I just assumed it was my neck and upper back acting up and that it would get better. I really struggle sometimes determining what is just my back being my back and what is related to MS. \n",

      "I feel pretty confused by all of this because I dont have any lesions in my spinal cord showing on an MRI and nothing new in my brain, though for some reason they didnt use contrast this time for any of my scans and perhaps something small was missed in my spine? My specialist is concerned that based on my symptom presentation and the exam that my spinal cord is inflamed and that I am having a relapse. He said that MRIs cannot see everything and it doesnt pick up small lesions or all of the inflammation that is happening in the CNS. He has prescribed me a course of the devils tictacs (steroids ) to take to try and speed things up and reduce symptoms. \n",

Something not a lot of people talk about with the recovery is lack of energy.

The shoulder pain from the gas right after the surgery was some of the worst pain I've ever experienced in my life, but it gets a lot better once you walk it off. However, that was difficult too. It was pretty difficult to do literally anything other than lay down or sit up on pillows and sleep. I had to have help sitting up for about a week. All of this stuff from the first week, however, subsided pretty quickly as I started to be able to get back to normal life.\n",

Most of the weight loss can be attributed to this surgery and the liquid diet and eating much smaller portions because your stomach is a third smaller, however in my personal experience I also started taking a stimulant Vyvanse for my ADHD which makes me eat a LOT less and also have impulse control over my snacking. I still believe you will lose a good bit of weight just from the surgery alone no matter who you are because of the liquid diet and eating smaller portions (ESPECIALLY the smaller portions, I can hardly eat anything at one time anymore, but I am hungry more times in a day because of this).\n",
      "\n",
      "What I want everyone to know about this surgery that not a lot of people talk about is that, in my experience, it is more of a trade-off than a fix. Yes, I haven't had a single issue with GERD since I woke up afterward, but I also have not been able to expel gas from my system or have a normal bowel movement since then either. I have been taking the absolute maximum strength Gas X and Metamucil every morning and every night since my last surgery follow up appointment because these issues never got better. If I miss one dose of either of these supplements, it will take 2 days or more to get regular again. And the supplements don't completely fix it. I also eat very very small amounts, which was nice at first cuz I needed to lose weight, but now that I'm at a healthy weight it's kinda aggravating eating such small amounts many times a day to satiate hunger, but that's probably the least significant issue I've had.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another thing I've encountered that I haven't heard much about is sugar intolerance. I have a much harder time consuming sugar now, especially in drinks. I can't drink any drink with any more than maybe 20% of your daily value of sugar because it hurts my stomach so bad. I just turned 21 in February and I have come to terms with the fact that my drink choices are very limited due to the fact that carbonation and sugar make me sick. Simple syrup, for example, will make my stomach hurt so bad I have to go home and go to bed if I even have just a few sips. It sucks, but it's worth it to have to make some lifestyle changes to get rid of the acid reflux. I will say though, the carbonation issues have gotten less and less as time has gone on. I can even drink seltzers now (as long as they don't have lots of sugar, of course). \n",
      "\n",
      "I am also unable, of course, to vomit. I haven't had anything come up at all since then. It's tried a few times though, and let me tell you, it sucks! In my personal experience, the few times my body has tried to make me throw up, I've been stuck retching for up to an hour or more. It's very painful, and it will keep going for a long time. I contracted a stomach virus a few months ago and had to go to the hospital because I kept uncontrollably retching to the point I couldn't breathe and almost passed out. It was very scary, but that was only 1 time, and after that I asked for a stronger anti-nausea pill (I take Zofran now) and I have it on me AT ALL TIMES, just like my inhaler. I'd suggest if you feel at all like you might be sick, TAKE IT! Other than those few times though, the inability to throw up hasn't been much of a issue.\n",

      "Oh, also as a side note, I still can't lift things that are very heavy/awkward without it hurting the site. Also the scars healed up pretty well. Still visible of course, but I'm covered in scars from being a wild child and working in a kitchen (lol) so I don't really care about them, but for anyone that does, I don't think they go away for a while.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I'm very very glad, even/especially at my young age, that I chose to have this surgery. I was in so much pain and couldn't do a lot of things normal people my age could because it hurt me so bad/made me sick. I couldn't sleep without my whole bed being propped up, I couldn't eat 4 hours before bed, I couldn't eat anything spicy or tomato without completely regretting it later, etc. It absolutely changed my life. The recovery was hell, I had to make some lifestyle changes, I still can't do some things \"normal\" people my age can do, but it's worlds better than what I was dealing with. I could immediately sleep at any elevation without it burning and choking on bile. I can eat pretty much any food I want (except for much sugar, but that's okay). I can eat right before bed if I want, I can eat spicy food all day long, I can eat Mexican, etc.! I have so much more freedom! It still does cost 1. money of course, and 2. still a little freedom. You have to be careful to take care of it well. You want it to last as long as possible, and you don't want to hurt yourself.\n",

      "**TL;DR: I'm very happy with my decision to go through with the surgery and most people would benefit from it I believe. However, there are many trade-offs/nuances I wish I had been more aware of. My quality of life is worlds better after this surgery and I would encourage everyone who qualifies to discuss it with your doctors and specialists, and don't be afraid of the recovery. It's so worth it!**\n",

      "In October, my uric acid level was 9.1 mg/dL. I started taking these supplements closer to the beginning of November, along with 10,000 IUs of vitamin D & 200 mcgs of K2 per day. I had my levels remeasured this week and my uric acid is now at 8.0 mg/dL. In my opinion, this is a significant improvement from supplements on their own.

I believe that the byproducts from sugar/high fructose corn syrup and refined carbohydrates causes more uric acid production than that of animal meat. Sugar and refined carbs also cause dehydration, which in turn, promotes the buildup of uric acid. Over the past 2 years, my poor diet has consisted of an incomprehensible amount of sugar and refined carbs because of fast food consumption, (often multiple times per day). I have insulin resistance, (high insulin promotes more uric acid production), low vitamin D, and a vitamin B deficiency. \n",

      "\n",
      ">THE RELATION BETWEEN CREATINE AND GOUT\n",
      ">Based on scientific research, the relation between creatine and gout is fairly simple to explain. Creatine  as well as foods high in creatine  will overwhelm the body with purines  the primary cause of gout. As a result, the creatine supplementation will inevitably increase the levels of uric acid and the probability to develop gout. The same effects will target men with or without gout. Creatine can cause flareups in those with gout, but it can also cause gout in those without it.\n",
      "\n",
      ">On the same note, if you take a creatine supplement and you experience gout, you need to cease the supplementation and discuss it with your doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      ">Bottom line, there is a very solid relation between creatine and gout. Just like you research labels to find foods with no purines whatsoever, you should do the same for supplements  and creatine is highly contraindicated. Even if you do not experience flareups while taking creatine or you do not have gout, chances are the high levels of uric acid will take you there at some point or another.\n",

      "\n",
      ">The researchers were from Monash University and led by Professor Sam El-Osta who said that while the gene implicated in POTS  norepinephrine transporter (NET)  had been known for several decades, past research had failed to find a genetic mutation responsible for the symptoms. This latest study revealed that the enzyme EZH2 is responsible for silencing this gene.\n",
      "\n",
      ">\"We predicted that inhibiting this epigenetic condition could reactivate NET gene function and used a pharmacological drug called GSK-126 that could specifically inhibit EZH2 activity with dramatic results, Professor Sam El-Osta said. This is the first description of NET reactivation using a drug. The beauty is that it allows us to target very specifically the enzyme to reactivate gene function.\n",

      "My boyfriend (33 - Moderna x3) has an appointment with his new neurologist in an hour and when I asked him to ask the doctor about Covid he said dont be silly, Covid is a lung disease. Everything Ive read says it affects the neurological and circulatory systems. Im not so worried about his epilepsy making a bout with Covid worse - Im worried about having his frequency of seizures change for the worse if he got it. Hoping to hear from epileptics who have had Covid (or found articles about it) who can say whether or not catching it increased or decreased their frequency or severity of seizures. I hope Im worrying needlessly but the thought of having his epilepsy get any worse has caused me to be extra careful. Im worried about myself since Im an ex-smoker but him having more than the 2 to 4 tonic clonics he has every year if he gets Covid would just be icing on the damn cake.\n",

      "*After reviewing the epidemiological data about the association between EBV and MS in the late nineties I become convinced that EBV is the cause of MS. One of the reasons why I moved academic institutions, from UCL to Queen Mary University of London, was to study EBV and to develop an MS prevention research programme. Despite being very positive I found that it was difficult to convince my colleagues and the wider MS community to invest in EBV-MS research. I was fortunate enough to get an MRC grant application, but since then I must have had at least 20 grant applications around the EBV-MS hypothesis rejected. It is very disheartening when this happens.*\n",
      "\n",
      "*The good news is that in 2017 Professor Nick Wald, Director of the Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, suddenly realised that the evidence I had presented to him in 2007 was stronger than he had appreciated and agreed with me that EBV was the likely cause of MS. This lead us to hold a workshop on EBV and MS and led to a successful grant application to the Barts Charity to start the Preventive Neurology Unit (PNU).*\n",

Dr Ruth Dobson is doing an amazing job at getting this off the ground. We are also taking forward our ideas around treating MS with antivirals that target EBV. To say that the funding for doing these trials has been difficult is an understatement, but I am hoping if we can get pilot data we can convince the sceptics to fund larger more definitive trials.*\n",

      "\n",
      "*Even if Moderna proves that their EBV vaccine is effective in preventing EBV infection and infectious mononucleosis we will still have to overcome the public resistance to vaccination and convince public health officials that using EBV vaccination to prevent MS is a worthy objective. The battles ahead are numerous, but we will get there in the end. We have to.

      "Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have.

      "\n",
      "The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.\n",

I feel better than I did (symptoms aren't as bad, ecspecially where he gave me the articular shots in my ankles) but still very chronically fatigued, aching (now it's my knees that ache the worst) and I have a really bad dry rash on my hands that tears open and bleeds. I was referred to a new internalist who just finished her schooling last year and told me today that she doesn't think I have lupus, raynuads and thinks I just damaged my meniscus ( my doctor before her mentioned meniscus and that is a place that hurts, but I know the pain from this feels WAY different than the stiff, aching feeling in my knees.) My grandmother had lupus and was diagnosed on her deathbed. She suffered a 3 hour seizure, her brain had shrunk and she had cirrhosis of the liver. Years prior to this she would swell up huge in her ankles and knees and feet, she also had the butterfly rash. When telling the doctor this she told me \"those aren't usual lupus symptoms, swelling was probably from the cirrhosis of liver\", which is true but clearly that all happened from untreated lupus!!!! In fact the doctor who diagnosed me is the one who diagnosed my grandmother. Anyway, she had also told me my hands were eczema (could be but I've never had eczema and this had gotten progressively worse as my symptoms got worse earlier in the year). I asked her if it's not lupus what could this be and she said probably just damaged knee, didn't have any other ideas.i could tell she didn't believe me, thought I was over exaggerating.  WHAT ABOUT ALL THE OTHER SYMPTOMS? Does my meniscus affect everything else I'm experiencing???? Ugh. I am just frustrated and don't know what to do. She sent me off with blood work to test if I have lupus ( ANA test was positive) and said come back in 3 months. I'm so upset I just want to feel better and not be in pain.\n",

      "Hydroxychloroquine being researched as a potential treatment option for primary progressive multiple sclerosis\n",
      " A research team led by Dr. Marcus Koch and Dr. Wee Yong (Co-Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of AnthoBio) at the University of Calgary that investigates a generic drug, hydroxychloroquine, in primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) recently published its clinical study results in Annals of Neurology. The study followed 35 PPMS patients over a period of five years. Throughout the study, 14 patients were expected to develop a significant reduction in their walking function. However, only 8 patients had experienced a reduction by the end of the study. Thats almost a 50% reduction in the number of PPMS patients negatively affected by continuing disability. Although the results will require confirmation in a larger trial, this study has shown that hydroxychloroquine could help slow down the disability progression of PPMS. This study opens the possibility for future treatment option for PPMS and the researchers hope their work will inspire future larger scale clinical research on the drug for PPMS.  \n",

Turns out, I went unconsious and had a tonic clonic seizure, then started acting like a tired wacko once they kind of got my attention, without me remembering it, so my step mother called an ambulance. The dudes in our basement were paramedics and firemen (Idk why the firemen showed up, but thats who my step brother they said showed up). I ended up going into the ambulance where a lady was driving, the guy was trying to talk to me to make sure I was alright, and my step mother grabbed me some food and a T-shirt because I bit my tongue when I fell face first and I had blood on my sweater, and she came in the ambulance with me (Her mother was there to watch the other kids). So I was in a hospital that I'm usually taken to for this stuff, and they were giving me sugar stuff through an IV.

I found that it affects your heart rate so I decided to test mine while resting and then standing to see if maybe thats what it could be. I took my heart rate three times while laying in bed. at 1:37am, by heart rate was 73bpm. at 1:39am, my heart rate was 74bpm. at 1:40am, my heart rate was 73 bpm again. I then stood up (right next to my bed) and proceeded to take my heart rate again.

I have paranoia a lot, but it was really bad when I saw the people in the vents. Sometimes I still see them, but I moved so its not as often. I try not to look at vents now.

Ive wanted to see somebody about it, but I didnt wanna be put on meds if I was schizophrenic. Im not really sure what to do, I just wanna know whats going on with me. I see shadow people too but I think thats just haunting stuff oh and I have severe anxiety so I always feel like people are watching me and talking about me which I saw somebody else talking about, but I was really freaked out for like two months last year because I watched a lot of conspiracy stuff and every time I would go out I swear everyone would stare and look at me with a blank expression on their face n it scared the f*** out of me.

A friend of mine with CF had symptoms that closely mirrored what I've dealt with for years.

Knowing that I am a carrier and now have a 25% chance of passing on a df508- gene, does it make me selfish that I still deeply want kids? Is it selfish to knowingly risk it?

      "Epstein-Barr virus infects most people at some point in their lives. Most of the time, EBV infections dont cause noteworthy symptoms, though the virus can cause infectious mononucleosis (colloquially known as mono).\n",
      "\n",
      "An accumulating body of research has shown a connection between EBV infection and MS. Most recently, a study of more than 10 million U.S. military members showed that infection with EBV increased the risk of developing MS by more than 30 times, placing EBV as the leading cause of MS.\n",
      "\n",
      "*EBV may be the only risk factor required to develop MS, given essentially 100 percent of people living with MS have been infected with EBV, Lawrence Steinman, MD, a professor at Stanford University and co-author of the study, said in a press release.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite this known connection, it was unclear what series of biochemical events could lead from EBV to MS.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The new study shows that this connection may lie in immune cells called B-cells, which are best known for producing infection-fighting antibodies. A given antibody is able to bind tightly to a specific molecular target  called an antigen, which may be, for example, a piece of a virus  which triggers the immune system to attack.**\n",
      "\n",
      "B-cells basically float around the body with antibodies primed on their surface. If their antibody binds to its antigen, the B-cell becomes activated, rapidly dividing and spewing out pro-inflammatory signaling molecules to sound the alarm to the rest of the immune system.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an activated B-cell divides to produce more cells, the cells undergo a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). Basically, this involves making small changes to the antibody structure that aim to increase the antibodys ability to stick to its specific antigen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, scientists analyzed B-cells collected from nine patients  five with a first onset of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and four with a relapse of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). From analyses of thousands of B-cells, the researchers showed evidence that many of these cells were behaving as though they were attacking an antigen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The team then selected 148 unique B-cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (the liquid surrounding the brain and spinal cord) for further analysis, looking at the antigens that these B-cells antibodies were targeting. The team noted that six of the nine patients had B-cells that targeted an EBV protein called EBNA1, and they performed detailed structural analyses of a particular antibody, called mAb MS39p2w174, that bound to a particular region of EBNA1 referred to as AA365-425.\n",
      "\n",
      "The scientists then noticed that the AA365-425 region of the EBNA1 protein is structurally quite similar to a part of a human protein called GlialCAM. The GlialCAM protein is expressed by certain cells in the brain, including notably oligodendrocytes  the cells chiefly responsible for producing myelin, the fatty sheath around nerve fibers that is the target of the autoimmune attack in MS.\n",
      "\n",
      "From all these data, the researchers constructed a conceptual model for how EBV might spur the development of MS.\n",
      "\n",
      "**First, patrolling B-cells would come in contact with the infecting virus, and some B-cells with antibodies that target the EBNA1 protein would become activated. In the course of activating, these cells undergo SHM, which could inadvertently increase the antibodys ability to target GlialCAM.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**The antibodies then bind to GlialCAM that is expressed by healthy cells in the nervous system, which triggers the immune system to attack  ultimately leading to the development of an autoimmune disease.**\n",
      "\n",
      "***Until now, we didnt have a step-by-step account of how this drives the immune system to attack a persons own myelin sheath. This new research fills in those gaps and provides clarity into how EBV infection can cause MS, Steinman said.***\n",
      "\n",
      "The results imply that targeting EBV infections might be a useful strategy for treating MS  and indeed, Steinman noted, this idea is already being explored. For example, Atara Biotherapeutics is sponsoring a Phase 2 clinical trial called EMBOLD (NCT03283826) to test ATA188, an experimental therapy that aims to kill EBV-infected cells in progressive forms of MS.\n",
      "\n",
      "***These new data further link MS to EBV-infected B cells and plasma cells, highlighting the role of EBV antigens, including EBNA1 protein, in the development of the disease, said AJ Joshi, MD, Ataras chief medical officer.***\n",
      "\n",
      "*Importantly ATA188, Ataras investigational MS therapy, targets key epitopes of these antigens, including EBNA1, with the hope of ultimately delivering a new treatment option for the millions of people currently living with MS, Joshi added. The actively enrolling Phase 2 EMBOLD study, with a formal interim analysis planned for [the second quarter of] this year, will be a major step toward that direction.*\n",

The reason I got diagnosed is cos since before Christmas Ive had severe tenesmus, diarrhoea and alternating constipation, gas, cramps, bloated ness the works hoenstly!! Now this has been going on for 3 months obviously, it has gotten better, and I actually went about a week with normal poops and no pain! (It was amazing) but then it came back, usually starts with a flare of diarrhoea, then back to constipation for days, I can still go when Im constipated, but it hurts, sometimes its very little but often, its really mixed and Im just worried. I get super gassy, and stomach makes heaps of noises, sometimes I get nausea which isnt uncommon with my anxiety ect, please can someone tell me how Id know if I had a bowel obstruction. I visited the doc twice last month and just got told I probably have ibs, that is all, and it was great to hear after years of pain and on and off suffering, but now its been 3 months of constant suffering, worrying and all the rest and Im so over it! It honestly feels like when Im pooping and stuff is coming out that there is more in there all the time. I have read and heard a partial bowel obstruction would cause vomiting, and severe nausea and a lot more pain! And probably no passing of gas or stool! Im really really scared honestly, can anyone give me some reference as to how they felt with it? Would I be in more pain ect?\n",

      "There have been some interesting studies recently on treatment of PTSD, End of life trauma, and Depression with psychedelics.  I recently finished reading how to change your mind by Michael Pollan in the book, Pollan chronicles a study where end stage cancer patients were given psilocybin therapy to help them cope with the anxiety and depression surrounding their death. The study participants reported an overwhelming positive response to the therapy and offered them relief from the fear of death. This book had me wondering if psychedelic therapy could have applications in cystic fibrosis and other chronic illnesses patients, and if so, what would that look like? what experiences have people had when they have taken recreational psychedelics? And do they feel like their feelings towards their disease or their management of CF has benefited from their psychedelic experiences? Let me know Im genuinely curious!

Then a cough started, always at night, lasting between 1-3 hours, i thought it was the smoking so i reduced the cigarettes but it still happened. The doctor did an xray said my lungs are fine and just to stop smoking, but even stopping smoking didn't fix it.

I would get overstimulated way easier and it would put me into severe crying episodes, couldn't stop myself, and had to call into work. I would start off irritated, it would turn to almost rage, then into bawling. They happened a couple days, then I felt normal for a while. Now I have noticed that it happens just periodically. If I had to estimate, maybe 3-4 days a month? I also feel exhausted the next day after this. \n",

It made me write this. \n",

      " Memory is SO bad I am even having trouble remembering if I took my trileptal after I have had it in my hand. Or, my pill alarm goes off, I'm busy, I have forgotten within 5 minutes until the second alarm goes off. I have 3 alarms and still take them late sometimes. This is the easiest example, but the memory is SO BAD I can't even think of any more examples at the moment. \n",

When I was a teenager and early 20s I was very unhealthy. Exessive alcohol, red meat, and lots of processed carbs. I started getting really sick, like really bad IBS. As well as getting ill I would also feel sick/bloated after food. My psoriasis was also horrible, with thick plaques on my head and on parts of my body and legs. I stopped eating meat about 9 years ago and through trial and error noticed that gluten was making me feel sick after eating. After cutting these out, my IBS started getting better and would only have occasional flare-ups. I still drank too much and that had an impact on my psoriasis which remained persistent. Not sleeping would give me trouble and so I would drink to sleep, an unhealthy shitty cycle.\n",

I went from being overweight/fat (85kg+) to 66kg muscular/lean. I cut alcohol down to a bare minimum. Every few weeks I may have a few cocktails or a few more with the occasional party, and many times months with no drinking.  My psoriasis disappeared and IBS was virtually non-existent (spare from when I stupidly couldn't resist a few bits from my GFs delicious-looking pizza). I would like to add that I have also cooked almost every day for the past few years, healthy delicious fresh food.\n",

That night I thought I was dying, which sounds so stupid as it was just a foot! I hobbled to the hospital yesterday and they did an x-ray and blood test. Lo and behold my uric acid level was 8.0 and my inflammatory markers were way high.\n",

      "Hello!  Im a guy with MS who has previously had low testosterone numbers pre-dx (eg below 12 nmol/L).  Ive been feeling especially crappy lately (low energy stuff).  So rather than just accept its MS, I dove into the rabbit hole of trying to find why I feel crappy and came across something interesting that may affect others in here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since my dx, Ive been taking supplements to help control my MS.  And my regime and DMT have worked.  My MS went from highly active at dx to NEDA now.  One thing I do every day is I take a flax seed oil + curcumin capsule.\n",

      "Now, back to me feeling crappy.  I went to an endocrinologist, described symptoms I was having, and she sent me for a blood panel.  It came back with a ridiculously high testosterone number.  Like almost 30 nmol/L - an unnatural number for my age and totally inconsistent with my prior panel.  I should be rocking a massive erection constantly.  But instead, its barely even just okay.  Likewise with body hair, I dont have very much.  And Im hardly very muscular either.  Somethings not right with that number.\n",

      "So I started reading and found an association between flax seed oil and testosterone that fit:\n",
      "\n",
      "The reason that flaxseeds are on the hit list for raising testosterone is because they are rich in lignans, which tend to mimic estrogen in the body. Since estrogen is the opposing sex hormone to testosterone, the more of it you have (particularly if you are a man), the more low testosterone-like symptoms youll have.

      "\n",
      "The effect of estrogen-mimicking lignans fits as a culprit for feeling crappy in a hypogonadism sense - but it also seems to fit the unexplained data from Dr Jeliniks study showing how much more effective flax seed oil was compared to other Omega-3s, since lignans are a unique element not found in fish oils.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only that Omega-3 study had an endocrine panel, this theory might be solved.  It seems like tapering down flax seed oil intake would help me feel better- but could also reduce beneficial effect of the high testosterone on my MS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not sure which path to take.  But an interesting set of associations!  If any smart person has any guidance or this is all wrong, would be helpful!\n",

      "*Summary: A study of monozygotic twins allowed researchers to discover which parts of immune dysfunction in multiple sclerosis were influenced by genetics, and which were influenced by environmental factors.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers at the University of Zurich and Munichs LMU Klinikum hospital have studied the immune system of pairs of monozygotic twins to identify the influence of the environment and of genetics in cases of multiple sclerosis. In the process, they may have discovered precursor cells of the disease-causing T cells.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Genetic predisposition alone does not lead to MS**\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies in recent years have clearly shown that genetic risk variants are a necessary condition for developing multiple sclerosis. Based on our study, we were able to show that about half of the composition of our immune system is determined by genetics, says Florian Ingelfinger, a Ph.D. candidate at the UZH Institute of Experimental Immunology.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the study, the researchers recruited 61 pairs of monozygotic twins where one twin is affected by MS and the co-twin is healthy. From a genetic point of view, the twins were thus identical. Although the healthy twins also had the maximum genetic risk for MS, they showed no clinical signs of the disease, says Lisa Ann Gerdes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Thanks to this globally unique cohort of identical twins, the researchers were able to exclude genetic influences by comparing twins with and without multiple sclerosis.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*We are exploring the central question of how the immune system of two genetically identical individuals leads to significant inflammation and massive nerve damage in one case, and no damage at all in the other,* explains Burkhard Becher. **Using identical twins enabled the international team of scientists to rule out the genetic influence and specifically track the immune system changes that were ultimately responsible for triggering MS in one twin.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*Surprisingly, we found the biggest differences in the immune profiles of MS affected twins in to be in the cytokine receptors, i.e., the way immune cells communicate with one another. The cytokine network is like the language of the immune system,* says Ingelfinger.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The researchers found that increased sensitivity to certain cytokines leads to greater activation of T cells in the blood of patients with multiple sclerosis. These T cells are more likely to migrate into the central nervous system of patients and cause damage there. The identified cells were found to have the characteristics of recently activated cells, which were in the process of developing into fully functional T cells. *We may have discovered the cellular big bang of MS hereprecursor cells that give rise to disease-causing T cells,* says Becher.**\n",
      "\n",
      "*The findings of this study are particularly valuable in comparison to previous studies of MS which do not control for genetic predisposition, says Burkhard Becher. We are thus able to find out which part of the immune dysfunction in MS is influenced by genetic components and which by environmental factors. This is of fundamental importance in understanding the development of the disease.*\n",

I'm looking into the psychological effects such \"miracle cures\" can have for people who grew up with very different expectations.\n",

      "RESEARCH: Longitudinal, 20-year Study, Shows EBV May Trigger MS\n",
      "For decades, researchers have suspected that people infected with an exceedingly common virus, Epstein-Barr, might be more likely to develop multiple sclerosis, a neurological illness that affects a million people in the United States. Now, a team of researchers reports what some say is the most compelling evidence yet of a strong link between the two diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The virus infects nearly everyone in their teen or young adult years, and very few go on to develop multiple sclerosis. **The researchers also note that it is not the only known risk factor for people who develop the illness. But they say their data points to it being the clearest of them all.** While it remains to be seen whether the finding will result in treatments or cures for multiple sclerosis, the study may further motivate research into therapies and vaccines for the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "In their [*study*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj8222), published Thursday in Science, the group examined data from 10 million people on active duty in the United States Armed Forces over two decades. The strength of their study, said its principal investigator, Dr. Alberto Ascherio, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, is that they were able to follow people for years and ask whether infections with Epstein-Barr preceded multiple sclerosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the service members in the study, 801 developed multiple sclerosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the same time, the virus in question, Epstein-Barr, is common, infecting nearly everyone in the population at some point. Although few are aware that they were infected, some develop mononucleosis. The virus remains in the body for life.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Because so few who are infected with the virus get multiple sclerosis, it cannot be the sole cause of the disease. Other risk factors have been identified, including some, like low levels of vitamin D and smoking, that were seen previously by the Harvard group using the same data set. There also are genetic factors  900 abnormal genes have been identified in patients with multiple sclerosis, said Dr. Anthony J. Reder, a multiple sclerosis expert at the University of Chicago, who was not involved in the new study. Gender also plays a role; most patients are women.**\n",
      "\n",
      "But, Dr. Ascherio said, *no risk factor stands out like Epstein-Barr infections.*\n",
      "\n",
      "**To ask how much the virus increases risk, the investigators studied the small proportion of people who were not infected with the virus early in their service careers but subsequently became infected. They detected infections by the presence of antibodies to the virus.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Among the multiple sclerosis patients, 32 out of 33 got infected with Epstein-Barr before they developed M.S.**\n",
      "\n",
      "As a control group for their study, the scientists tracked 90 individuals who were not initially infected with Epstein-Barr and who also did not get multiple sclerosis. **Of them, just 51 subsequently became infected with Epstein-Barr. That meant an Epstein-Barr virus infection increased the risk of multiple sclerosis over thirtyfold, Dr. Ascherio said.**\n",
      "\n",
      "But Dr. Reder cautioned that it could be hard to tease out cause and effect from an epidemiological study. People who develop multiple sclerosis have overactive immune systems that make them develop high levels of antibodies to viral infections. Multiple sclerosis might arise not because of the virus but because of the bodys response to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "*Multiple sclerosis patients have fewer viral infections than normal, he said, because their immune systems are so active that they effectively fight off viruses. Multiple sclerosis patients often say, I never get a cold. When I hear that, my ears perk up.*\n",
      "\n",
      "So far, he added, anti-viral drugs have not helped patients with multiple sclerosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Harvard group tried to control for the possibility that the immune systems response, not the virus itself, increases the risk of multiple sclerosis in those infected with Epstein-Barr. They asked if antibodies to another common virus, cytomegalovirus, also were linked to a greater risk of multiple sclerosis. They were not.\n",
      "\n",
      "But cytomegalovirus, Dr. Reder said, for unknown reasons, seems to protect against multiple sclerosis. So the fact that those infected with it did not have a higher risk of multiple sclerosis might not be surprising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others said the study was convincing evidence of cause and effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "*The way it was done is quite compelling, said Dr. Michael Davin Kornberg, a multiple sclerosis specialist at Johns Hopkins. It really is the most convincing data weve had for a causal association.*\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Bruce Cree, a multiple sclerosis researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, noted that it might be difficult to treat multiple sclerosis by going after Epstein-Barr because it can be difficult to find the actual virus in patients. Even though multiple sclerosis is a disease of the brain and spinal cord, he could not find the virus in patients spinal fluid.\n",
      "\n",
      "But patients do seem to harbor cells in their brains that produce antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus. Dr. Cree is researching whether he can treat multiple sclerosis patients by eradicating those cells, which are infected with Epstein-Barr.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Dr. Lawrence Steinman, a multiple sclerosis researcher at Stanford, who wrote a perspective accompanying the Harvard groups paper, said an experimental mRNA vaccine against Epstein-Barr was one of a number of approaches being designed to stop the virus from affecting the brain.\n",

      "Like many others here my story began several years ago with constant nagging, gnawing heartburn for which I was prescribed Omeprazole. This seemed to remedy my symptoms, and even though I've always had a fear/aversion to being on a long-term medication before I knew it, it had been 3 years or so. Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   \n",
      "Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  \n",
      "I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  \n",

The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.   \n",

People come here looking for ways to avoid being on life long medication or how to mitigate pain or how to stop a flare.  This article points to a lot of the things people try to control gout flares that aren't drugs.  Please understand control of uric acid levels - when talking about gout means keeping your UA levels lower than 6mg/dL (5 if you have tophi) and keeping it there.  Everything else is trying to stop gout flaring - your immune system response to monosodium urate crystals.\n",

      "In reality you have probably been hyperuricemic for quite some time (years) as uric acid isn't usually tested unless there is an issue.  Monosodium urate crystals have been building up in your joints.  Then one day you stub your toe or eat that trigger food that causes inflammation - and you have a gout flare.  You take anti-inflammatories(NASID) and/or immunosuppressants(colchicine) to stop your immune system response.  At some point the immune system may stop and the crystals get sheathed - until you stub your toe again or eat that foot that causes inflammation.  Rinse/Repeat.  The gout flares ebb and flow with your immune system response - not with crystals coming and going.  When you go onto a Urate lowering therapy it could be months to years before all the crystals dissolve - even though your uric acid is held low.  6 months after I had my UA levels at 5.5mg/dL - I still flared which means that there were still MSU crystals present.  Controlling serum uric acid levels needs to be a constant low - with a threat of flaring anyway as the crystals dissolve and the sheaths get disturbed.  Eating your way to a low enough serum acid level is difficult in my experience.  \n",

      "Hi,\n",
      "I have recently joined reddit for another issue unrelated to what I will post about here. My boyfriend and his mom for the past five years have been caregivinging for my boyfriend's 29 y.o. brother. \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend's brother has an unusual form of epilepsy. He has multiple seizures a day, and has had them every day starting 5 years ago. He has, as I understand it, hypermotor seizures, and does not have the tonic clonic seizures. So when he has individual seizures, he doesn't need to go the the ER, but the seizures involve a lot of arm and leg movement, and he can injure himself, or potentially injure others, quite seriously. \n",
      "\n",
      "My boyfriend's brother has had epilepsy since he was a baby. His epilepsy has always been intractable, but before the increase in his seizures five years ago he would generally have nighttime seizures that didn't impact his daily life. I don't know a lot about his medication, but I know he is on quite high amounts of anti-seizure medication. I know that the college of pharmacists in our area issues him a letter every so often, because he is on a very high doses of anti-seizure medication. As I think people know here in this subreddit, the anti-seizure medication has lots of side effects that affect daily life. My boyfriend's brother is also trying professionally prescribed CBD treatments, but he finds this frustrating because the cbd is not covered by our government Healthcare plans and he pays a high amount for CBD oil and doesn't feel like it's making much of a difference. \n",
      "\n",
      "He also had a neuro surgery to help, but after a few months the seizures became just as frequent as they were before the surgery. I believe it was confirmed my boyfriend's brother has \"focal cortical displasia.\" My understanding is that neurologists were able to confirm this after examining brain tissue after the surgery.\n",
      "\n",
      "His form of epilepsy has affected his daily life quite a bit. My boyfriend's whole family would like him to live at home. Another problem is the uncertainty of the situation.  My boyfriend's brother and the whole family hopes the situation will improve, but there is no knowledge about what can be expected. I think the other option is to put their 29 year old family member in long term care, which the family is very uncertain about and saddened about putting a loved one, as a young man, into a long term care facility. They do not want to pursue this option. I don't know if anyone here has had this challenge: whether to put a loved one (or personally deciding) about going into a long term care facility, or trying to live at home.\n",

      "Is there anyone else here who has experience, personally or another loved one, with intractable epilepsy, focal cortical displasia, or with hypermotor seizures? \n",

      "\n",
      "I don't live with my boyfriend's brother. At the moment the mom, and the two brothers are all living together to support one another. As I date my boyfriend over time, I am here with the family during weekends, over holidays and such. Although my boyfriend's brother is an adult, and I don't live with the family, i am not really involved in his care, I'm just more of a witness to what's going on with the family, and am interested to learn more. \n",

I read an article here a few months back about having family with different autoimmune diseases and then getting ms and wow does that really connect the dots for me.

In late adolescence my allergy to the sun became less severe but still have all the same symptoms as I did when I was a kid. Imagine my surprise when I went for blood work and my vitamin d was 13.9 (the lowest threshold of normal is 31). I take daily otc vitamin d and was on 50,000 IU vit d for a month or 2 a few months back. Im back on the 50,000 IU again but Im thinking that my body doesnt absorb it well and the sun and I just dont get along lol. I mean there is no way to know for sure  but those are my theories.

I have only had one clinically isolated syndrome however, affecting my sensibility only.\n",

When I protested, he told me that e.g. ocrevus or kesimpta would not be paid for by the public health system -> I am living in Europe. And that high efficacy medications would mean a higher risk of side effects. Well, I told him I am aware of this and think it is still a good idea as I want to avoid any further lesions as much as possible but he argued against it (costs too much, risks too high, etc).\n",

I think that the rash on my face is malar however, unlike what Ive read here where people say it comes and goes, mine is constant..I have non-itchy patches of red on my forehead, cheeks and chin which are constantly there.\n",
      "\n",
      "The skin is hot to touch (with the exception of sometimes the nose being cold but still red and the worse thing is  twice a day Id get a sort of hot flush on my face and the red will extend even more down the cheeks and up to the temples and my eyebrows. No amount of make up can hide it, let alone appease the burning feeling Im feeling. It lasts for a couple of hours.. I cant seem to pinpoint whats causing the flush. In addition to that I feel like my head is on fire even though I dont have temperature and my ears are burning all the time.. Anyone can relate to this? I know I'm getting ahead of myself but Im afraid that if the rash is so intensive, maybe it wont be alleviated with meds if I get them prescribed.. I'm attaching a picture of the rash on my forehead.\n",

      "Gout in pinky knuckle\n",
      "Well I guess Im following my fathers footsteps. Before he passed at 68 his knuckles looked like golf balls from untreated gout. I have been prone to flare ups in both my right and left big toes since my early 20s. Now in my mid 30s, I have just had my first flare up in my right hand pinky knuckle. I got to say its just as painful as getting it in the toe. I dont know why every doctor I go to either prescribes me colchicine, prednisone or indomethacin. I would think with a flare up 1-2 times a year they would start me on a maintenance drug, especially with the family history. I thought it might be a staff infection since Ive never had a flare up in my hand. So Im sitting at urgent care waiting to see what they say. I was sick all last week with the flu and I think that is what triggered it. I hadnt had any alcohol and was avoiding eating heavy as well as red meat. It could have been a mix of a little dehydration and weakened immune system. Has anyone else experienced a flare up after being sick with a bug?\n",

      "Some Info on Probiotics for IBS\n",
      "So I posted this in a comment and it was suggested that I make this info its own post. I did a bunch of research into what probiotics have shown to be effective for IBS in various research studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the links below, the collective summary is that these probiotic strains (alone or in combination with others) were effective in one or more studies in reducing one or more IBS symptoms in frequency and/or severity: \n",
      "\n",
      "Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745 (actually a yeast), Bifidobacterium longum 35624, Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum 299v, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I-3856, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019, Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, and Bifidobacterium bifidum MIMBb75.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may have missed a few in the above list, but the main gist is that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species probiotics, as well as Saccharomyces Boulardii, are the main researched probiotics that show some kind of improvement for IBS (though it also depends on the type of IBS, and most of them helped with one or some symptoms but not all of them - see links below for more detail).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, many of the studies couldn't draw conclusive evidence because there just wasn't enough data/research on specific probiotics yet, or because the studies didn't fulfill certain criteria. But they were able to state what evidence they did have, and identify what is likely to be the case based on findings so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bifidobacterium longum 35624 used to be called Bifidobacterium infantis 35624 and is still sometimes referred to that way. It is patented by Align, which is the brand name for that probiotic. Floraster is a leading brand name for Saccharomyces Boulardii CNCM I-745. There are other good probiotic brands too though (that have similar or different probiotic strains).\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of this will be trial and error as you find what works for you. Be sure to give each probiotic or probiotic blend you try at least a 4 week trial, since it takes a bit of time for your body to adjust and for the probiotics to get to a certain level in your system to start working.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a good idea to make sure that the probiotics are third-party tested and made in a GMC (or equivalent) registerred facility, to be sure you are getting exactly what's on the product label. I'm not sure exactly how it works in other countries, and that advice is US-based, but some level of quality assurance is generally advised.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, for those who aren't used to reading research papers like this, usually the important information is in the Results and/or Discussion section. Sometimes they put a summary of those near the top, and sometimes you have to scroll to the end of the article. It's also a good idea to read the abstract/summary at the top of the article so you have an idea of what the paper is about. Reading the other sections of the paper will give you more detail into what they did for the study, which will give more context, but isn't usually necessary to read the whole thing to understand the end results, which tell you what they found about the probiotics in relation to IBS.\n",
      "\n",
      "And of course, always talk to your doctor about medical stuff! I'm just providing this information in case it might be helpful. I am NOT giving medical advice or telling you all to take probiotics or endorsing any brands or types or anything. Whether you decide to take probiotics or not is up to you and your doctor. This is just an info dump in case anyone wanted to know this stuff.\n",

      "\n",
      "- sometimes it seems that other injuries or illnesses can trigger an attack. E.g. I got the flue and near the end of my flue symptoms a gout attack started, or on several occasions Id have a gout attack after getting another injury in my foot, (strained a muscle on the bottom of my foot when then led to an attack) \n",

      "I wanted to share my story in hopes it could possibly help someone or there are other people going through what I'm experiencing.   \n",
      "Like many others here my story began several years ago with constant nagging, gnawing heartburn for which I was prescribed Omeprazole. This seemed to remedy my symptoms, and even though I've always had a fear/aversion to being on a long-term medication before I knew it, it had been 3 years or so. Until one day the original symptoms came back, and this time way worse. I began experiencing that feeling of a fist trying to punch its way up and out of my chest. I even questioned if I had heart issues. It was pretty awful, so after several rounds of tests, including an Endoscopy, I was told I had a hiatal hernia. The GI Dr. switched me from 20 mg of Omeprazole to 40 mg and Pantoprazole and that calmed down the pain. Again, even though I was still wary of an even higher dose of daily medication, being relieved of the pain outweighed these fears and before I knew it, another 3 or so years had gone by being a slave to this drug.   \n",
      "Then about a year ago I began having horrible pain in my pelvic region. I won't go into all the details, but nothing about it made me think it was a GI issue, more of a urologic issue. So after rounds of antibiotics for what they thought was prostatitis, CT scans, and even cystoscopy (if you don't know that that is look it up. Basically medieval torture!) - all of it inconclusive. I was so desperate I even tried acupuncture which did nothing. I was beginning to believe I had CPPS (chronic pelvic pain syndrome), when as a last-ditch desperate move I decided to try eliminating gluten from my diet. To my astonishment, within a little over a week, all of my symptoms magically vanished!  \n",
      "I'm about 8 months into my gluten-free diet and feel great, but I began questioning what could have caused this. Why at the age of 41 did my body suddenly decide to reject gluten? I did a celiac test and it was negative and have no family history of gluten intolerance. After doing some research I came across a study that found a link between [PPI use and gluten intolerance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3947159/) and my jaw hit the floor.  \n",
      "I now believe this long-term use of PPIs has caused this and am currently in the process of trying to wean off the Pantoprazole by cutting it in half and taking it only every other day. The GERD symptoms have returned however so I've scheduled another appt with the GI Dr to discuss a way forward without PPIs. I'm holding out a small bit of hope that if I'm able to completely go off the PPPs the gluten intolerance could possibly reverse, but I know that's not likely.   \n",
      "Does anyone have any alternative approaches besides the obvious diet restrictions to keep GURD at bay without this evil medication?\n",

      "Im currently on keppra (750 mg) for focal epilepsy originating in the right motor cortex, and my mood has been unbelievably all over the place. Im literally joyous in the morning, raging in the afternoon, and balling my eyes out by the night time. Everyone in my family is on edge because of my mood swings and anger. Ive read keppra can be bad for people with pre-existing mental health conditions, and i have a few lol (severe social anxiety, ocd, depression). The worst is definitley how bad its making my anxiety. I dont wanna see friends, talk to strangers, or anything social im so anxious. From the moment they gave me keppra in the er i knew my social anxiety was worse. Im not responsive to antidepressants, so adding them on is not an option. The thing is ive only been on this medication since I had my second seizure on december 19th. Ive never felt so low in my life though. I feel like im developing a phobia of epilepsy and I feel helpless. Im petrified of having another seizure but my mental health is detriorating. My neurologist is great but shes putting a lot of freedom in my hands to decide and im scared. Do I stick with keppra longer or do i try something else? :(\n",
